# Cursor AI Rules for Java Examples Repository

## Project Context
This is an educational repository containing Java programming examples and demonstrations for CS18000 (Problem Solving and Object-Oriented Programming). Each module is self-contained with comprehensive examples.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Java Conventions
- Follow standard Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add comprehensive Javadoc comments for classes and public methods
- Keep methods focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Use proper exception handling (try-catch, try-with-resources)
- Always close resources (files, streams, scanners)

### Documentation
- Every class should have a header comment explaining its purpose
- Complex algorithms should have inline comments
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Maintain README.md files for each module

### File Organization
- One public class per file
- Package structure: com.cs18000.moduleXX
- Organize by module in separate directories
- Keep related classes together

## Module Structure
Each module should include:
- README.md - Comprehensive documentation
- QUICKSTART.md - Quick start guide
- pom.xml - Maven configuration
- compile.sh - Compilation script
- run.sh - Execution script
- src/main/java/ - Source code

## AI Assistance Preferences

### When Creating New Code
- Include comprehensive comments explaining the educational purpose
- Provide multiple examples demonstrating the concept
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Create interactive demonstrations when possible
- Add sample input/output examples in comments

### When Explaining Code
- Start with high-level concept explanation
- Break down complex logic step-by-step
- Relate to course concepts (CS18000)
- Provide analogies for difficult concepts
- Reference relevant Java documentation

### When Debugging
- Check for common Java pitfalls (null pointers, resource leaks, etc.)
- Verify exception handling is appropriate
- Ensure resources are properly closed
- Check for thread safety if applicable
- Look for performance issues (unnecessary loops, etc.)

### When Adding Features
- Maintain consistency with existing module structure
- Update all relevant documentation
- Add appropriate unit tests if applicable
- Ensure backwards compatibility
- Follow the established patterns in the codebase

## Educational Focus
- Code should be clear and understandable for students
- Prefer clarity over clever/compact code
- Include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic
- Demonstrate best practices
- Show common mistakes and how to avoid them

## Build and Run Commands
- Compile: `./compile.sh` or `mvn compile`
- Run: `./run.sh` or `mvn exec:java`
- Each module is independent

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing through interactive demos preferred
- Include verification output in demonstrations
- Show expected vs actual results
- Test error conditions and edge cases

## Prohibited Patterns
- Don't use deprecated Java features
- Avoid wildcard imports (import java.util.*)
- Don't catch generic Exception without good reason
- Don't leave TODOs or incomplete code
- Avoid magic numbers - use named constants

## Best Practices
- Always use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable resources
- Prefer specific exceptions over generic ones
- Use meaningful exception messages
- Initialize collections with appropriate capacity when known
- Use StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops
- Close scanners and other resources
- Validate input before processing

## Module-Specific Guidelines

### Module 07 (File I/O and Exception Handling)
- Demonstrate all three I/O layers (low-level, high-level, object)
- Show both text and binary file operations
- Include comprehensive exception handling examples
- Demonstrate try-with-resources
- Show buffering concepts
- Explain checked vs unchecked exceptions

### Future Modules
- Follow the same structure as Module 07
- Include interactive demonstrations
- Provide comprehensive documentation
- Create meaningful, educational examples

## Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reference module numbers when applicable
- Include co-author attribution for Claude Code
